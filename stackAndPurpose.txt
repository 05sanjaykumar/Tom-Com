 Project Description: Tom-Com (AI-Powered Movie & TV Personalizer)
Tom-Com is a personalized AI-powered movie and TV recommendation web platform. Users log in, set up their genre preferences, and receive curated recommendations. The platform scrapes movie and TV data from multiple online sources based on the selected genres — pulling in metadata, user reviews, summaries, and more.

Once a movie is shown, users can upvote, downvote, or comment, which updates their personal "taste profile" stored privately in Firebase. The taste profile evolves using a combination of GPT-based analysis, embeddings, and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), allowing the AI to suggest similar or better matching content in the future.

On selecting a movie, users are redirected to a movie detail page where they can chat with an AI assistant, asking questions like “Will I enjoy this?”, “Is it slow-paced?”, or “How emotional is this film?” — and the AI responds using scraped reviews and contextual insights.

The system emphasizes privacy and decentralization by storing user data and preferences individually on their Firebase account, not on a central server. The scraper runs dynamically per user genre interest and feeds the AI engine for hyper-personalized results.
